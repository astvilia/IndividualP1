# Machine Learning Class Assignment - Purchase Data Analysis

## Overview

This GitHub repository contains the code and documentation for an individual assignment completed as part of Introduction to Multimodal Machine Learning. The assignment focused on exploring basic concepts of the pandas library in Python and performing regression and classification analyses on purchase data.

## Data

The dataset used in this assignment is named `data.csv`. The data set used in this analysis was made to emulate the results of a study that looked at how users interacted with Siri to purchase flight tickets. The values included in this data set were whether or not the ticket was purchased, the System Usability Survey Score provided by the user, the different types of errors made by Siri and their frequency, the duration of the dialogue between the system and the user, and the gender of the user

## Requirements

To run the code and reproduce the analysis, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python (version 3.x)
- pandas
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- seaborn

Install these dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
